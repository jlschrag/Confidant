Confidant is a voice note transcription app, designed to handle multiple input & output directories, sorting by keyword, note aggregation, & conversion to PDF.  It runs locally, with no data sent to third parties.  Currently in an alpha state, and not yet ready for use by the general public.

# Prerequisites
1. Python >=3.12
2. `uv` - a Python package installer (`pip install uv`).
3. An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA is recommended for hardware acceleration of the transcription process. The application will fall back to using the CPU if a compatible GPU is not found.

# Setup
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `uv lock && uv sync` from the root directory
3. Create a `config.yaml` in the root directory with the following structure (omit any sections not needed):

_Note: If `filters` are set for the `text-outputs` in the `config.yaml`, the transcriber will check the first twelve words of a recording for filter keywords and route the resulting transcription files accordingly._
